   - [ ] Estimate benefits of the project 
   - [ ] Define/quantify (very precisely) a success metric for the project: a single quantifiable, unambiguous

## NOTES

 - Write for your specific audience not a general one. The introduction should be direct at users 
   already knowlegable of your problem at a superficial level.
   
 - You need to check for spelling and grammar.
 
 - It is not clear that you understand the business justification the model or 
   how it will be used by the end-user. You will greatly benefit if you answer 
   these questions.
   
 - I am not sure 95% accuracy of the prediction of gestational diabetes is a good
   metric. What is the normal incidence of gestational diabetes. What is it in 
   the risk population?
